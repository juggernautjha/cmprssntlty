#### Basically me fooling around
I got hooked to EE274, and Stanford has the Stanford Compression Library. This is just me shamelessly trying to copy it in GO. I know I am a masochist, but no better way to learn a language, right?
I shall also be posting my rants regularly here.
##### Go sucks!
Why do the functions I wish to import have to be capitalized. I miss good ol' python. Save me god.
