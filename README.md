#### Basically me fooling around
I got hooked to EE274, and Stanford has the Stanford Compression Library. This is just me shamelessly trying to copy it in GO. I know I am a masochist, but no better way to learn a language, right?
I shall also be posting my rants regularly here. And in the docstrings. If you want to use this for anything even remotely _professional_ I would recommend you edit the comments.
##### Go sucks!
Why do the functions I wish to import have to be capitalized. I miss good ol' python. Save me god.
##### Co-Pilot Rocks
Gilfoyle was right. 
##### Aaargh
Why in the H-E-double-fuck does Go have docstrings **ABOVE** the function definition. 
##### Go is Goo
No context, go fys. Also copilor is sexy.
